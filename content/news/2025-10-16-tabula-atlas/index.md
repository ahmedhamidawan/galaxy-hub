We are excited to announce that two comprehensive single-cell reference atlases, [Tabula Sapiens](https://tabula-sapiens-portal.ds.czbiohub.org/) and [Tabula Muris Senis](https://tabula-muris-senis.ds.czbiohub.org/), are now available for easy import directly into your Galaxy history!

# What are Tabula Sapiens and Tabula Muris Senis?

**Tabula Sapiens** is a comprehensive reference atlas of the human body at single-cell resolution, profiling over 1.1M cells from 28 organs of 24 normal human subjects. This landmark dataset provides a molecular reference for understanding human cell types, states, and their variation across individuals.

**Tabula Muris Senis** is a comprehensive resource for the mouse aging cell atlas, containing over 350,000 cells from 23 tissues across the mouse lifespan. This atlas enables researchers to study aging processes at the cellular level and understand how different cell types change with age.

# Why are these atlases important?

These reference atlases are invaluable resources for:

* **Benchmarking and validation**: Compare your single-cell data against comprehensive reference datasets
* **Cell type annotation**: Identify and annotate cell types in your own experiments using reference signatures
* **Cross-species comparisons**: Study evolutionary conservation and differences between human and mouse cell types
* **Aging research**: Investigate age-related changes in cellular composition and gene expression

# How to use these atlases in Galaxy?

Using these atlases in Galaxy is simple:

1. **Create an account** on [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.eu) and log in with your credentials
2. **Navigate to the Upload** on the left panel
3. **Select** `Choose from repository`
4. **Search for "Tabula Atlasses"**
5. **Select "Tabula Sapiens"** or **"Tabula Muris Senis"**
6. **Select the atlas** (or specific tissues) you want to work with
7. **(optional)** Click on the setting icon and select `Defer dataset resolution`
7. **Import directly to your history** with a single click on `Start`

You can upload the data as deferred datasets, meaning that the data is not directly copied to your history but it's linked. So while you can access the data, it is not counted as your storage quota!!

# Get Started Today

These comprehensive reference atlases are now ready to accelerate your single-cell research. Whether you're annotating cell types or studying aging, Tabula Sapiens and Tabula Muris Senis provide the foundation you need.

[Our recent publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666979X25002617) gives an overview of all the Galaxy tools/workflows/training resources.
