## LLM Hub: Accessible Large Language Models for Everyone

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized how we process and analyze text data, offering powerful capabilities for tasks ranging from content generation to complex reasoning. However, accessing these models often requires API keys, payment setups, and technical expertise that can be barriers for many researchers. Today, we're excited to introduce [LLM Hub](https://usegalaxy.eu/?tool_id=llm_hub) - a tool that makes powerful AI models accessible to everyone.

When you use LLM Hub, your data is processed like any other Galaxy jobâ€”securely and privatelyâ€”at the University of Freiburg's compute center, using encrypted connections, without permanently storing inputs or outputs, and fully protected within Galaxy's established privacy framework in compliance with European data protection standards.

## Available Models

LLM Hub offers access to a carefully curated selection of models, each optimized for different use cases. These models are currently hosted at the University of Freiburg and represent our initial offering.
This collection may expand in the future with additional models from various providers.

If you have a community model you'd like us to consider adding, contact [contact@usegalaxy.eu](mailto:contact@usegalaxy.eu).

## Key Features

### Multiple Input Types
LLM Hub supports various input formats depending on the model type:
- **Text files** (TXT, HTML, JSON) for text-based analysis
- **Images** (JPG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, BMP) for visual understanding
- **Combined inputs** for multimodal analysis

### Workflow Integration
As with all Galaxy tools, LLM Hub seamlessly integrates into larger analytical workflows. You can:
- Process data with other Galaxy tools before LLM analysis
- Use LLM outputs as inputs for downstream analysis
- Create reproducible workflows combining traditional data processing with AI capabilities
- Share complete analytical pipelines with colleagues

### Use Cases

The versatility of LLM Hub makes it suitable for numerous research applications:

**Text Analysis & Processing:**
- Summarize research papers or documents
- Extract key information from unstructured text
- Translate content between languages
- Perform sentiment analysis on social media data
- Generate structured data from free-form text

**Image & Document Analysis:**
- Extract text from scanned documents (OCR) or Excel screenshots ðŸ˜±
- Describe scientific images or experimental results
- Process screenshots of interfaces or applications

## Getting Started

Using LLM Hub is straightforward:

1. **Select your model type** based on your input data (text, image, or multimodal)
2. **Choose the appropriate model** for your task complexity and requirements
3. **Upload your context data** (optional) - this can be text files, images, or both
4. **Enter your prompt** describing the task you want the LLM to perform
5. **Run the tool** and receive your results in Markdown format

The tool's intelligent interface guides you through the selection process, ensuring you choose the right model for your specific needs.

## Technical Implementation

LLM Hub is powered by a LiteLLM proxy server hosted at [the University of Freiburg's computing center (RZ)](https://www.rz.uni-freiburg.de/en).
