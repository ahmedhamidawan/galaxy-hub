From **1–3 October 2025**, the [University of Freiburg](https://uni-freiburg.de/en/) hosted a packed, three-in-one meeting: **European Galaxy Days (EGD)**, the **[ELIXIR Galaxy Community](https://elixir-europe.org/communities/galaxy) face-to-face meeting**, and the **[EuroScienceGateway (ESG)](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/) Final Meeting** with ~100 participants (87 in person + 12 online). Running side-by-side, these events created a special week where platform maintainers, tool and workflow developers, and domain scientists aligned roadmaps and moved from slides to practical solutions and future collaborations.

Across talks, demos, Birds-of-a-Feathers (BoFs), and a concluding hackathon, the week showed how the Galaxy ecosystem is advancing research across domains from [microbiology](https://microbiology.usegalaxy.org/), [Materials Science](https://materials.usegalaxy.eu/), [ecology](https://ecology.usegalaxy.eu/), [Climate science](https://climate.usegalaxy.eu/), [imaging](https://imaging.usegalaxy.eu/), and [digital humanities](https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig/digital-humanities/). Freiburg’s campus hosted hybrid sessions and BoFs across multiple rooms, with Friday dedicated to a focused Co-Fest & Hackathon where groups squashed bugs, improved tools, tuned workflows, and formed plans for next collaborations. Coverage rolled out on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/tags/EGD2025), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/hashtag/EGD2025?author=galaxyproject.bsky.social), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23egd2025&origin=HASH_TAG_FROM_FEED&sid=kCg) (47 posts with #EGD2025), while Matrix channels ([usegalaxy-eu Lobby](https://matrix.to/#/#usegalaxy-eu_Lobby:gitter.im) and [use-galaxy announce](https://matrix.to/#/!ArjKhGljVCmzqxhauY:matrix.org?via=matrix.org&via=matrix.uni-freiburg.de&via=t2bot.io)) supported live coordination and announcements.

Thank you to the University of Freiburg, ELIXIR, the European Commission, and everyone who contributed talks, demos, code, and reviews. Community momentum is strong—the next cycle is already underway. Are you ready for GCC2026 in Clermont-Ferrand (France) from June 22-24 2026?
